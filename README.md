I'm a <b>Systems engineering</b> student with a thing for <i>cybersecurity</i>
and <i>game development</i>.

I'm still in the learning process; that is,
I have yet to work on a real application project.
My experience doesn't go beyond writing small and
simple console programs.

So far, I've had an enjoyable experience learning with
the <i>C++</i> and <i>Lua</i> programming languages.

I'm also a <i>GNU/Linux</i> user, though still inexperienced.
